# Attribution Graph Replication — Clinical Trials

## Project Goal

Replicate the Cross-Layer Transcoder (CLT) methodology from:
> *Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models*
> https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html

Then apply attribution graphs to clinical trial prompts to identify features involved
in reasoning about eligibility criteria, adverse events, and endpoint inference.

## Long-Term Goals

1. **Complete Pythia-410m proof-of-concept** — finish current training run, generate
   graphs for all 14 clinical prompts, label features, produce notebook readout.

2. **Scale to MedGemma-27B + MIMIC-IV** — apply CLT to a medically-trained model on
   real clinical notes. Requires PhysioNet credentialing (long-lead item — start early).
   Check Gemma Scope 2 for pre-trained transcoder availability before training from scratch.

3. **Find cross-trial generalisable features** — which features fire consistently across
   trial types vs. which are condition-specific? This is the core scientific question.

4. **Publish and communicate** — target ML4H or CHIL workshop; write at least one public
   technical post. Keep the GitHub repo as a clean public reference implementation.

These goals serve two purposes: contributing to mechanistic interpretability in the
clinical domain, and building a public portfolio for a career pivot into clinical AI.

## Key Architectural Facts (read before touching clt/model.py)

From the paper (§ Building an Interpretable Replacement Model):

- The CLT has **L encoder matrices**, one per layer. Each reads from the residual stream
  `x_l` at its layer using a linear encoder + **JumpReLU** nonlinearity.
- Each feature at layer `l'` contributes to **all subsequent MLP outputs** via separate
  decoder matrices `W_dec[l' → l]` for each `l >= l'`.
- MLP output reconstruction at layer `l`:
  `y_hat_l = sum_{l'=1}^{l} W_dec[l'→l] @ a_l'`
- Training loss = MSE reconstruction (summed over layers) + L1 sparsity penalty.
- JumpReLU: zero below threshold `θ`, linear above. Threshold is a learned parameter.

---

## Attribution Graph Facts (read before touching graphs/)

- **Freeze** attention patterns and LayerNorm denominators before computing attributions.
  This makes feature→feature interactions linear and attribution well-defined.
- Nodes: CLT features, token embeddings, reconstruction errors, output logits.
- Edges: linear effects between nodes. Feature pre-activation = sum of input edges.
- Pruning: keep top-K nodes/edges by contribution to target token logit. See §Appendix:
  Graph Pruning for the exact algorithm.
- Export format must match `anthropics/attribution-graphs-frontend` JSON schema.
  Check `frontend/README.md` for the schema spec before writing `graphs/export.py`.

## Development Rules

1. **Always start with the toy model test** (`tests/test_clt_toy.py`) before running on
   Pythia. The toy model is a 2-layer, d_model=64 transformer. If the pipeline doesn't
   pass on the toy model, don't scale up.

2. **Log everything to wandb** during CLT training: per-layer reconstruction MSE,
   sparsity (L0 norm of activations), total loss. Group runs by model size.

3. **No magic numbers.** All hyperparameters (L1 coefficient λ, JumpReLU threshold θ,
   pruning K) live in `clt/config.py` as fields of `CLTConfig`.

4. **Shapes in comments.** Every tensor that passes between modules should have its
   shape annotated in the line above, e.g.:
   ```python
   # (batch, seq, d_model)
   x = hook_point.hook(resid_pre)
   ```

5. **Do not modify the frontend submodule** except to update the JSON it reads.

6. **Every milestone gets a notebook.** Each item in the Current Status checklist must have
   a corresponding notebook in `notebooks/` that renders its outputs visually before the
   next milestone begins. Notebooks are the primary format for non-technical readouts —
   use plain-English section headers and captions, not just code and plots.

7. **Use `viz/` for all figures.** Never call matplotlib directly in scripts or notebooks
   without going through a function in `viz/features.py` or `viz/graphs.py`. This keeps
   figures consistent and reusable. Add to `viz/` as new plot types are needed.

---

## Clinical Trial Prompt Guidelines

Prompts live in `prompts/`. Each file exports a list of `TrialPrompt` dicts:

```python
TrialPrompt = TypedDict('TrialPrompt', {
    'id': str,               # e.g. "eligibility_nsclc_001"
    'text': str,             # the prompt text
    'target_token': str,     # token whose logit we trace (e.g. "eligible", "yes")
    'domain_tags': list[str] # e.g. ["oncology", "NSCLC", "eligibility"]
})
```

Start with **10–15 prompts per category**. Prioritize:
- Eligibility: NSCLC, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma (oncology focus)
- Adverse events: hematologic toxicity, hepatotoxicity
- Endpoints: PFS, OS, ORR definitions

When labeling features found in attribution graphs, record labels in
`prompts/feature_labels.jsonl` (one JSON object per line, keyed by feature index).

---

## Compute Notes

- CLT training on Pythia-410m: expect ~4–8 GPU-hours on a single A100 for a reasonable
  run. Use gradient checkpointing if VRAM is tight.
- Activation extraction: extract and cache residual streams + MLP outputs to disk first
  (`scripts/extract_activations.py`), then train CLT offline. Don't re-forward Pythia
  on every CLT training step.
- For local dev/testing, use `pythia-70m` (6 layers) — fast enough to iterate on CPU.

### Pre-termination checklist (run before killing any Lambda instance)

- [ ] Graph JSONs: `scp 'ubuntu@<ip>:ignis/frontend/graph_data/*.json' frontend/graph_data/`
- [ ] Inference checkpoint: strip optimizer state first, then `scp ubuntu@<ip>:ignis/checkpoints/.../clt_inference.pt checkpoints/.../`
- [ ] Feature activations: `scp ubuntu@<ip>:ignis/data/feature_activations.jsonl data/`
- [ ] Feature labels: `scp ubuntu@<ip>:ignis/data/feature_labels.jsonl data/`
- [ ] graph_features.json: `scp ubuntu@<ip>:ignis/data/graph_features.json data/`

**Rule: run all 5 scp commands before terminating. The HDF5 (~20GB) stays on the instance
and is re-extracted cheaply (~$0.10, ~1 min on A10). Everything else must come home.**

## Findings So Far

- `sparsity_coeff=2e-4` is too weak — reconstruction dominates and L0 saturates near n_features.
  Updated default to `1e-2`. L0 still high at 500 steps on 50k tokens; expect improvement at scale.
- Activation extraction uses `monology/pile-uncopyrighted` streamed from HuggingFace.
  Requires `zstandard` for decompression. Default slice: 50k tokens for dev.
- Training loop is model-agnostic via `ActivationLoader` protocol — switching models
  only requires a new loader, not changes to `clt/train.py`.
- CLT must always be moved to the same device as the model it's paired with.
  Call `clt.to(next(model.parameters()).device)` at entry points (`build_attribution_graph`,
  test fixtures). Never scatter `.to(device)` calls on individual tensors inside helpers.
- Attribution graph completeness (sum of edges to logit / logit value) is ~0.5–0.8 with an
  untrained CLT (large reconstruction errors dominate). Expect 0.85–0.99 after training.
- H100 training speed: ~1.37 steps/s with batch_size=512, n_features=2048, 24 layers. 50k steps ≈ 10hrs.
  n_features=4096 exceeded H100 VRAM (81GB needed vs 79GB available) — settled on 2048.
- steps/sec timing added to `_log()` in `clt/train.py` (elapsed, eta, steps/s).
- HDF5 random sampling caused 0% GPU utilization (512 random seeks per step). Fixed by sampling
  contiguous blocks instead — critical when chunk size is 1024 tokens.
- HDF5 now stores `token_ids` dataset (int32) for feature labeling context reconstruction.
  Old HDF5 files without this field need to be re-extracted before running label_features.py.
- flush_every default changed 500→5 to prevent ~200GB RAM accumulation before first disk write.
- torchvision/torchaudio conflict on Lambda: pins torch==2.5.1, incompatible with torch 2.11.0.
  Removed from setup_lambda.sh; uninstall manually on existing instances.
- `frontend/` is tracked as a gitlink (embedded repo), not a proper submodule. Contents won't
  clone with the outer repo. Convert with `git submodule add` if needed.
- Frontend util.js rewrites all absolute paths to transformer-circuits.pub — added localhost
  check to skip rewrite for local development.
